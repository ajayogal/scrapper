## Security Best Practices

### For Users

1. **Keep Dependencies Updated**
   ```bash
   npm audit
   npm update
   ```

2. **Use Latest Node.js LTS**
   - Minimum: Node.js 14.0.0
   - Recommended: Latest LTS version

3. **Secure Environment**
   - Run in isolated environments when possible
   - Use containers for production deployments
   - Limit network access if not needed

### For Developers

1. **Input Validation**
   - All user inputs are sanitized before use
   - URL validation prevents malicious redirects
   - Query parameters are properly encoded

2. **Browser Security**
   - Puppeteer runs in sandboxed mode
   - No-sandbox flag only used when necessary
   - User agent rotation for anonymity

3. **Data Handling**
   - No sensitive data is logged
   - Scraped data is not persisted by default
   - Memory is properly cleaned up

## Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability, please:

1. **Do NOT** create a public GitHub issue
2. Email the maintainers directly (if applicable)
3. Provide detailed information about the vulnerability
4. Allow reasonable time for response and fix

## Security Considerations for Web Scraping

### Legal and Ethical
- Always respect robots.txt files
- Comply with website terms of service
- Implement appropriate rate limiting
- Use scraped data responsibly

### Technical Security
- **IP Blocking**: Websites may block aggressive scraping
- **CAPTCHA**: Some sites implement anti-bot measures
- **Rate Limiting**: Respect server resources
- **User Agent**: Use realistic user agent strings

### Recommended Practices

1. **Proxy Usage**
   ```javascript
   // Example: Using proxy with Puppeteer
   const browser = await puppeteer.launch({
     args: ['--proxy-server=http://proxy:port']
   });
   ```

2. **Request Delays**
   ```javascript
   // Add delays between requests
   await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 1000));
   ```

3. **Error Handling**
   ```javascript
   try {
     // Scraping logic
   } catch (error) {
     console.error('Scraping failed:', error.message);
     // Don't expose sensitive information
   }
   ```
